                    <p> <br><br><br>Mudmee is a unique way of hand weaving fabric on old wooden looms. Mudmee is an ancient
                        type of woven cloth produced in areas of Isan in the northeastern region of Thailand. Mudmee
                        weaving is known as ikat weaving throughout the world, but in Thailand, the technique is
                        referred to as mudmee weaving. Mudmee is a weaving pattern used to create hand woven
                        fabric with a pattern or design. Mudmee weaving creates a pattern with only one thread. The
                        exact areas of a thread that are to be dyed a certain colour, are controlled by a tie-dying
                        method. Mudmee is produced through the traditional method of tying in the desired pattern with
                        straw, hay or banana ropes. These ties prevent the dye from affecting the thread underneath
                        them, a bit like simply tie-dying does. </p>

                   <p>Mudmee or ikat is hand woven Thai silk or cotton fabric
                    that comes from Isaan, Thailand&#39;s Northeastern region
                    that is made up of 17 provinces on the Khorat plateau.Â 
                    
                    Located about 400km from Bangkok and 55km south of
                    downtown Khon Kaen, Chonnabot is renowned for
                    mudmee silk made using a technique in which warped
                    and/or weft threads are tie-dyed before weaving.
                    Chonnabot has a 1km road called Silk Road in front of
                    the district office where numerous silk shops line the
                    street. The Khon Kaen Silk Festival is an event held in Khon
                    Kaen, Isan, Thailand over ten days at the end of
                    November and the beginning of December each year. It
                    was first held in 1980.
                    The event is centred on promotion of the local silk
                    industry, but includes a wide range of other activities
                    including parades and performances.</p>

                    <center><img height="240px" src="./img/m6.JPG"></center> <br><br>
                    <p>In terms of production, the Queen Sirikit Department of
                        Sericulture estimates that in 2013, 2,87,771 kg of silk
                        cocoons were produced by 71,630 small landholders.
                        
                        Another 2,552 farmers produced around 1,45,072 kg of
                        silk.
                        
                        Coming to export rates, in 2006, 1,45,40,325 US dollarsâ
                        worth of silk was exported from Thailand, where silk
                        fabrics (including Mudmee fabric) accounted for about
                        half the silk exported. Thai silk accounts for a mere 0.1%
                        percent of global production, with most of it being used
                        locally. The Thai weaving industry is considered an important
                        part of the overall economy of the country, as can be
                        seen from its ranking as the 12th worldwide export item,
                        with a value of about 4,300 million USD per year
                        (Thailand Textile Institute, 2012). This number shows
                        that the textile industry is crucial to the overall economy
                        of the country. In addition, the textile industry is the
                        basis of many sub-businesses, such as the suppliers of
                        raw materials, cotton and silk, through the cloth-weaving
                        industry. The overall industry employs approximately
                        1,023,000 people, which is 19% of the labour in the
                        production part (Office of Industrial Economics, 2011). </p>

                        <center><img height="240px" src="./img/m5.JPG"></center> 
                        <p> <br><br><br>The dyes are fiber reactive. That means a chemical
                            reaction takes place between dye molecules and the
                            fabric molecules. The dye bonds with the cotton and
                            actually becomes a part of the fabric. That is why the
                            dyes are so permanent and vibrant after several
                            washings. And mudmee is a type of tie-dye. Cotton is
                            made of long strands of cellulose molecules, all twisted
                            together. Cotton is ideal for dyeing because the fibers
                            are naturally hollow, and the dye molecules will form
                            bonds on both the inside and outside of the fiber. If you
                            put molecules of dye and cotton together, very little will
                            happen until the atoms on the surfaces of the molecules
                            are prepared for bonding. This can be done by either
                            increasing the temperature or the pH of the fiber and
                            dye. In the lab, we will do the latter, increasing the pH by
                            soaking the fabric in calcium carbonate, which causes
                            the release of a H atom from the cellulose molecule. The
                            removal of the H atom leaves the cellulose molecule
                            with some atoms that do not have stable octets. As a
                            result, the dye can bond to the cellulose molecule at the
                            site of the removed H atom. After the dye is applied, it is
                            
                            allowed to react in a desirable host environment for up
                            to 24 hours. After this time, the bonding sites on the
                            cellulose should be saturated with dye molecules.
                            Excess dye molecules that have not bonded
                            permanently are washed away using warm water rinse
                            and a dye-carrying detergent.
                            Thai ikat, or Mudmee, is traditionally dyed with natural
                            colours that come from various sources such as plants,
                            stones, fruits etc. The yarns are boiled once more so
                            that the colour stays fixed.
                            Many elements, along with their ores are used in the
                            making of dyes for Mudmee. These include Cinnabar
                            (mercury ore), Red Lead, Malachite (copper ore), Red
